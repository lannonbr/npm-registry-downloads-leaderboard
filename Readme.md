# NPM Registry downloads leaderboard

A project to examine the top packages on the npm registry. To start I looked at all non-scoped packages on the registry which equates to ~1.4 million packages as of the date when I ran this.

To view the dataset collected as of Sept 24, 2022, visit the downloads.csv file. Do note due to the size of npm registry the file is over 30MB.
